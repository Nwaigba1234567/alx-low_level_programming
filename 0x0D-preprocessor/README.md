ALX C-Structure, typedef

For this project, we will use the following files and functions:

*dog.h - Define a new type struct dog with the following elements:

*name, type = char * age, type = float owner, type = char *

*1-init_dog.c - A function that initialize a variable of type struct dog

*2-print_dog.c - A function that prints a struct dog

*dog.h - A new type dog_t as a new name for the type struct dog

*4-new_dog.c - A function that creates a new dog.

*Prototype: dog_t *new_dog (char * name, float age, char *owner), You have to store a copy of name and owner Return NULL if the function fails

*5-free_dog.c - A function that frees dogs.
